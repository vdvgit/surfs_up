## Overview of the Analysis
Customer wants information about temperature trends in Oahu to determine the viability of opening a surf and ice cream shop -- questioning if this business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
Between December and June:
- 4 degree average temperature difference
- 8 degree minimum temperature difference
- 2 degree maximum temperature difference

## Summary
There is a small average temperature difference between December and June (these two months/points are used to model year-round temperatures). Given that data alone, it does not appear that the temperature trends will impact sustainability of the business year round. This is the same story for the maximum temperature difference of 2 degrees. The minimum temperature difference of 8 degrees may impact sales in the evenings/nights (54 degree min in Decemember is probably too cold for ice cream). 

## More Data Collection
If we wanted to assess this further it would be interesting to pull metrics on other weather conditions (rain, clouds, etc), pull tourism data for the year, and to compare to similar stores in locations with similar temperature/weather metrics.
